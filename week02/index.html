        <p> The JavaScript is often referred to as the language of the web, and most of web browsers can run JavaScript.
            The most common JavaScript engines are found in browsers such as Firefox, Chrome or Safari. JavaScript is also a dynamic language. </p>

              <li>For this week's readings, I have enjoyed the functions.</li>
              <li>Callbacks: A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.</li>
              <li> This technique allows a function to call another function</li>
              <li> A callback function can run after another function has finished</li>
              
              <li>
                <p class="example">Example of callback:</p>

        <p> Programming Basics - Things to consider</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Well commented codes.</li>
              <li>JavaScript Grammar</li>
              <li>Declaring and assigning constants and variables.</li>
              <li>Number Methods</li>
          </ul>
       
        <p> When writing your codes it is good practice to use functions for the following reasons:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>To improve the readability of code.</li>
              <li>To improve the reusability of the code, the same function can be used in any program rather than writing the same code from scratch.</li>
              <li>Using functions make debugging of the code easy, and errors are easy to be traced.</li>
          </ul>

        <p> In JavaScript there are two types of comment:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Single line comments starting with <mark>//</mark> and finishing at the end of the line. Example: // <em>this is a comment.</em></li>
            <li>Multi-line comments starting with <mark>/*</mark> and finishing with <mark>*/</mark>. Example: /* <em>This is a longer comment anything here will be ignored. This is a useful place to put notes</em>*/ </li>
          </ul>
       
        <p> JavaScript uses the keywords <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong> to declare variables. <br>
           The keyword <strong>const</strong> is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, whereas <strong>let</strong> is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>const name = <b>'Alexa'</b>; // <em>This won't be assigned to another string.</em></li>
            <li>You can even declare and assign multiple variables at the same time if you separate them with commas,for example (let x = 3, y = 4, z = 5;)</li>
          </ul><br>
        
        <p>There are two types of scope in JavaScript such as:</p>
        <ul>
           <li> <em>Global scope</em> — Global scope contains any variable defined outside of a block. 
             A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structures that create a code block. <br>
             A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.</li><br>
           <li> <em>Local Scope </em> — Local scope contains any variable defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where it’s declared.</li>
        </ul> <br>
    
    
        <p> The two most commonly used functions are function declaration and function expression<br>
            Function declaration example:<br>
                 function hello(){ console.log('Hello World!');} <br><br>

            Function expression example: <br>
                const goodbye = function(){ console.log('Goodbye World!'); };
        </p><br>

        <p> Also, there is a new syntax for declaring functions called <strong>arrow syntax</strong>. These make declaring functions much more succinct by using less verbose syntax.
            Arrow functions can be identified by the 'arrow' symbol,<mark> => </mark> that gives them their name</p><br>

            <h3 id="question">Questions:</h3>
            <p> Function declaration vs. Function expressions. <br>
                What is the main difference between a function declaration and a function expression?<br>
                What is a Callback in JavaScript and a Callback in real Life? <br>
                How many types of callback functions are there?<br>
                What is a WeakSet in JavaScript?</p>
