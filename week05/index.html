        <h2 id="note">My Notes: Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h2>
        <p>Debugging and testing, tools and tips <br>
        
            <h3>The Importance of Testing and Debugging</h3>
        
          <p>I learned how important it is to test and debug errors with JavaScript. I also found that as a programmer, 
             I should make sure that the code I write responds and that if there is any error, it can be identified and fixed quickly. 
             Therefore, I need to be aware of the exceptions, if possibly catch and fix them.  
             Failing to do so makes errors difficult to track down. </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Strict Mode</p>
          <img src="images/invoking_function.JPG" alt="Strict Mode">
          <p> Since it’s much better to spot errors early on, rather than have them cause problems later. 
              Writing code in strict mode can also help improve its clarity and speed.</p>
          <p>The recommended way to invoke strict mode is to place all your code into a self-invoking function:</p>
        </li>


   
        <li>
          <p><strong>'use strict'</strong> To enter in strict mode, you will need to enter the following string line in a JavaScript file:</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
       <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
       <ul> 
         <li>
         <p>The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Debugging in the Browser</h3>
        <p>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them.</p>
            
        <ul> 
         <li>
          <p><strong>Alert()</strong> method is the most basic form of debugging.</p>
          <p>The example below checks to see if a person’s age is appropriate:</p> 
            <img src="images/alert.JPG" alt="The Trusty Alert">
         </li>

         <li>
            <p><strong>ifBlock</strong> is used to see the correct value of the <strong>age</strong> variable, 
                the alert method has to be inside the if block.method is the most basic form of debugging.</p>
            <p>To check for equality, we should use <strong>===</strong> instead of <strong>= </strong>which assigns 
                a value to a variable (eveninside an if block).</p>
            <p>For all values of <strong>age</strong> that are <strong>less than</strong> 12, we could update the code as follows:</p>
              <img src="images/ifBlock.JPG" alt="If block method">
         </li>
         </ul>
        
        <h3>Debugging Tool</h3>
        <p>One of the most useful commands is the <strong>debugger</strong> keyword.</p>
        <img src="images/debuggingtool.JPG" alt=" Using a Console">


        <h3>Using the Console</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> A <strong>console</strong> object does provide a number of methods for logging information and debugging.</p>
                <p>Example of <strong>console</strong> with the <strong>age</strong> variable</p>
                <img src="images/console.JPG" alt=" Using a Console">
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Error Objects</h3>
             <p>An <strong>error object</strong> can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function, like so:</p>
             <pre>
             const error = new Error();
             //This constructor function takes a parameter that’s used as the error message:
             const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');
             </pre>
             <p> The seven other error objects used for specific errors:</p>
             <ul>
             <li><strong>Eval Error</strong> is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backward compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval()function.</li>
             
             <li><strong>Range Error</strong> is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
             
             <li><strong>Reference Error</strong> is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.</li>
             
             <li><strong>Syntax Error </strong> is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.</li>
             
             <li><strong>Type Error </strong> is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.</li>
             
             <li><strong>URI Error </strong>is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</li>
             
             <li> <strong>Internal Error</strong> is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.</li>
             </ul>
             <pre>
             //These error objects can also be used as constructors to create custom error objects:
             const error = new TypeError('You need to use numbers in this function');
             </pre>

             <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
             <p> We can handle exceptions by using the <strong>try</strong>,<strong>catch</strong>, and <strong>finally</strong><br>
             If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a <strong>try</strong> block. 
             This will run the code inside the block as normal, but if an exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown onto a <strong>catch</strong> block</p>
             <pre>
             function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
                 'use strict';
                 try {                                  //    <--- we put the try here
                     return String(squareRoot(number));
                 } catch(error) {                       //    <--- catch error below
                     return squareRoot(-number)+'i';
                 }
                 }
             </pre>
